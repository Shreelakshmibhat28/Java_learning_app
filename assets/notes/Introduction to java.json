    "Java Virtual Machine (JVM)": {
      "Definition": "JVM is an integral part of Java's runtime environment. It is responsible for executing Java byte code.",
      "JVM Components": [
        "Class Loader: Loads classes into memory.",
        "Execution Engine: Executes Java byte code.",
        "Garbage Collector: Manages memory by cleaning up unused objects.",
        "Runtime Data Areas: Stores data used during program execution."
